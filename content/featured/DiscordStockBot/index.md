The Discord Stock Bot analyzes the stock market by providing hourly and daily updates on stock
information on Discord.

It supports query commands to fetch stock details of a company for the present and previous day, stock history of multiple companies, historical stock details of company(s), and also allows for creating new channels by the admin.
